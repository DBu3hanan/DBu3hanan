Hello, my name is Diamond A. Buchanan.

I am an aspiring Web Developer and Database Administrator currently pursuing a Computing degree at The University of Technology, Jamaica. With a strong foundation in SQL, ASP.NET, Python, Java, and Microsoft Office Suite, I am passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly applications and managing complex databases.

Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on projects like Xfinity Tools, a web-based productivity platform that I created and have managed since 2022. This experience has enhanced my skills in web development, system architecture, and database management. If youâ€™d like to explore Xfinity Tools, you can do so at https://xfinitytools.github.io/.

I have engineered several other projects, including MarineMind and The IT Experience, which I plan to make publicly available in the coming months.
