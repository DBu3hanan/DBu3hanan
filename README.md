Hello, my name is Diamond A. Buchanan.

I am an aspiring Web Developer and Database Administrator currently pursuing a Computing degree at The University of Technology, Jamaica. With a strong foundation in SQL, ASP.NET, Python, Java, and Microsoft Office Suite, I am passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly applications and managing complex databases.

Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on projects like Xfinity Tools, a web-based productivity platform that I created and have managed since 2022. This experience has enhanced my skills in web development, system architecture, and database management. If youâ€™d like to explore Xfinity Tools, you can do so at https://xfinitytools.github.io/.

I have engineered several other projects, including MarineMind and The IT Experience, which I plan to make publicly available in the coming months. 

On my profile, you will find a variety of repositories showcasing several independent projects, each utilizing different programming languages. As I continue to refine my programming skills and expand my knowledge of the computing world, the collection will grow. I hope you find your time exploring my profile valuable.
